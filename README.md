## About the Game

This project is a simple, text-based implementation of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game is designed to be straightforward and serves as an excellent example for learning basic programming concepts like handling 2D arrays, user input, conditional logic, and game state management in Python.

## Features

* **Two-Player Mode:** Play against a friend on the same console.
* **Interactive Board:** A clear, ASCII-art representation of the 3x3 game board.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures players enter valid moves (e.g., correct format, unoccupied squares).
* **Win Detection:** Automatically identifies when a player has achieved three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
* **Draw Detection:** Recognizes when all squares are filled without a winner.
* **Play Again Option:** Allows for multiple rounds without restarting the script.

## How to Play

1.  The game board will be displayed with row labels (A, B, C) and column labels (1, 2, 3).
2.  Player 'X' goes first.
3.  When prompted, enter your move by combining a row letter and a column number (e.g., `A1` for the top-left corner, `B2` for the center).
4.  If the spot is valid and empty, your symbol will be placed.
5.  Players take turns until one player gets three of their symbols in a row or all squares are filled (a draw).
6.  After the game ends, you'll be asked if you want to play another round.

## Game Rules

The classic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe apply:

* Players take turns marking one empty square at a time.
* Player 'X' typically goes first.
* The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
